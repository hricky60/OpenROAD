* 0.17umX17um dielectric layer for top and bottom face
* Used for metal1 dielectric layer since thickness is 0.36um 
*
* Note: micro is too small of a scale so units are kept in meters and output is divided by 10^-6
* since capacitance scales
*
* dielectric name      |    3D coordinates of the four corners
