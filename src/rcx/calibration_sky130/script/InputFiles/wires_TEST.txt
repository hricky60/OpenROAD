* Five 0.17umX17um wires in parallel 
* spaced by .29, .17, .17, and then .29 um in LI1 layer
*
* Net Name: 06_M1oM0_W170W170_S00170S00170_x (x = 1-5)
*
*
* Note: Micrometer goes beyond the geometric threshold so units are kept
* in meters and the dielectric constant divided by 10^6 so the unit is in F/um to offset 
* geometric scaling
* 
* conductor 	      		| dielectric  | offset 
* file name 	      		| constant    | in space
