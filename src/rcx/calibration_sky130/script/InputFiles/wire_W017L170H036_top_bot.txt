* 0.17umX17um wire face for top and bottom face
* Used for metal1 and metal2 wires since thickness is
* 0.36um for those two layers
*
* Note: micro is too small of a scale so units are kept in meters and output is divided by 10^-6
* since capacitance scales
*
* conductor name      |    3D coordinates of the four corners

* top and bottom panel
